It's a website that showcases my projects from **GitHub** It uses GitHub API to fetch some of my repos and lists them. 
I used static generation due to GitHub's reauest limit, so it only does the request during the build time.
Though, at the same time it helped impove the loading speed because it also has to fetch all the necessary readme files.

_UPD_:
I partially incorporated **typescript** into this project.
